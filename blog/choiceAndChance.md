> The Only Thing I Do Know Is That We Have To Be Kind. Please, Be Kind. Especially When We Don't Know What's Going On.

â€” Everything Everywhere All at Once

Bad choices can lead to good outcomes, and good choices can lead to bad outcomes. Even when we are sure of what we want to do and act without hesitation, there is still uncertainty.

When we knock on the door of choice, chance is on the other side. So what to do in the face of uncertainty? What to do in a world where intentions do not guarantee outcomes?

Act with kindness. Act with courage. There will be doubt, and there will be failure, but from the dark of night comes the light of day. After every winter, there is a spring.
