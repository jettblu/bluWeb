> The Only Thing I Do Know Is That We Have To Be Kind. Please, Be Kind. Especially When We Don't Know What's Going On.

â€” Everything Everywhere All at Once

Bad choices can lead to good outcomes, and good choices can lead to bad outcomes. There is still uncertainty even when we are confident in our choices.

> We are answered by chance when we knock on the door of choice.

So what to do in the face of uncertainty? What to do in a world where intentions do not guarantee outcomes?

Act with kindness. Act with courage. There will be doubt, and there will be failures, but from the dark of night comes the light of day. After every winter, there is a spring.
