Anyone is capable of running a marathon. 26.2 miles is a long way, but the human body is powerful beyond belief.

The hard part isnâ€™t finishing a marathon; the hard part is starting a marathon. Getting to the starting line requires belief; not belief in God or the race organizers, but belief in yourself.

Religions around the world have perfected the art of belief.

Christians read the Bible.

Muslims practice Salah.

Buddhists meditate.

**Runners run the hard miles.**

The hard miles are unlike the easy miles.

Easy miles have been done before and can be done again. Easy miles feel good. Hard miles hurt.

Hard miles are an article of faith; when you run the hard miles, you increase your belief.

When you believe, anything is possible.

**Run the hard miles.**
