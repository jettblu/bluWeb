**∞ - -9 months:** We float around in space, forever 5.5 inches away from being a thing.

**2:** Tis’ a simple, befuddling existence: we throw more tantrums than we throw parties and cry more than we think.

**13:** We’ll never know more than we think we do when we’re 13.

**18:** We’re free to do as we choose, so long as we choose to go to college. We have a diploma, but no driver’s license—or maybe, that’s just me. 58.1% of us vote.

**21:** We marinate our minds in college and alcohol.

**25:** The majority have sex; the minority have kids. A lot of people do a lot of things because a lot of people expect them to.

**30:** We put our heads down and work towards a day when we don’t have to.

**44:** We’re a long way from the womb. Hopefully, we’re just as far from the tomb.

**50:** It’s our 32nd class reunion: we wonder where the time went and are shocked by how some of our classmates are already chillin’ in coffins.
**67:** We think about when we were 30 and yearning to be 67 so we could reap the benefits of social security and think about when we were 30.

**72:** We’re probably grandparents now.

**78:** There’s a lot of staring at our grandchildren and misplacing our dentures.

**86:** We’re officially out of date, but we don’t care: they love us anyways. Hopefully.

**90:** Just when we think we’ve overstayed our welcome, we’re thrown a raging birthday party. Or maybe it’s a ‘you can go now’ party, but we don’t care: we’re just having a good time.

**97:** If we haven’t died by now, there’s a good chance that this is the year.

**Death - ∞:** We float around in space no longer 5.5 inches away from being a thing. We already got lucky once; who’s to say we get lucky twice?
